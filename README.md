# CMPE 103 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
## Group 4: Topic 6 — Fonts, Colors, Images  

Welcome to our group repository for **CMPE 103 - Object-Oriented Programming**.  
This repository contains all the `.py` and `.ipynb` files used for our **Group Reporting on Topic 6: Fonts, Colors, Images**.

---

## 📚 About the Topic

**Fonts, Colors, and Images** are essential components of modern software applications. They help improve:

- User experience (UX)
- Visual appeal
- Readability
- Accessibility  

In this topic, we explore how to use **fonts, colors, and images** within GUI-based Python applications, mainly using the `tkinter` library.  
We also showcase the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** to structure and manage these elements in a clean and reusable way.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** (standard Python library for GUI)
- **Tkinter.ttk (ttk)** for modern themed widgets (buttons, labels, frames, etc.)
- **Pillow (PIL)** for advanced image handling (optional)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive demonstrations
